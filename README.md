In this Repository The Code I writtern in R language

There is a <b>rtwitter</b> Library It is most useful library in R By using this library we can extract the twitter Limited Rows(up to 3000 rows maximum) From the API.

Create Application(APP)keys from Twitter Developer account and apply on code.

Two methods follows:

1.User Timeline Method.

Your Home timeline displays a stream of Tweets from accounts you have chosen to follow on Twitter. This method can only return up to 3,200 of a user's most recent Tweets. we can extract upto ≈3000 rows and ≈89 columns from Twitter API.
